                    How Gigatech was born
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In 2021, a journey began in Montevideo, Uruguay. Fulanito Mengano Rodriguez, our beloved CEO
                    and founder of the company, noticed the business he worked for could use some help and started
                    giving out Excel sheets to his fellow teammates in order to manage their teams efficiently.
                    Eventually, it became a business idea on its own.
                    Since then, we have been striving to help improve  our customers productivity rates, branching out into 
                    software solutions of all kinds. Our patented strategies and diversity of layout sheets have enabled us
                    to reach over 150 companies in the span of only 6 months, granting us the title of Fastest Growing Company
                    of 2022 in the Trackathon Awards for companies in the field of Logistics.
